    design-process: "Design Process"
    design-process-content: "The culture Iâ€™ve worked to establish is that of highly rapid, transparent, and collaborative design and prototyping. We began with brainstorming workshops, low-fidelity sketches, wireframes, and then increased in detail as our vision became more defined. Additionally, we maintained a regular feedback loop with our users throughout the design process."
    design-process-footnote: "Based on our user feedback, it was clear that the navigation of Mobile Heartbeat needed to improve. Through card sorting studies, we were able to simplify the navigation and organize related functionality into intuitive groupings on the bottom tab bar."

    discovery: "Discovery Phase"
    discovery-content: "Our users have highly specific and complex workflows, and we needed to make sure to thoroughly research and understand them. Our research included shadowing, interviewing, focus groups & surveys. This ranged from observing a chaotic night shift in a Manhattan ER, to scrubbing into the OR to see how surgical teams communicate. As a result, we built a stronger understanding of the goals & frustrations of our customers."
    discovery-footnote: "We chose to follow the Lean UX Canvas for initial problem definition to help us maintain focus and establish measurable outcomes. Through our process, we formulated three hypotheses to measure against. In addition to a complete UI redesign of the application, we focused on solving the core problems around our information architecture, physician workflow, and speed of urgent communications."

    heading: "Mobile Heartbeat"
    overview: "Enabling clinicians to improve patient care through accelerated communication and collaboration in the hospital."
    overview-alt: "Mobile Heartbeat iOS, Android, and web applications."
    persona: "Clinical user persona"
    persona-footnote: "We created personas of our core users and gave them personalities, goals, and priorities. This helped us journey map ideal workflows during the design phase, and maintain a user-centric perspective for the other teams throughout the process. I'd like to introduce you to Cynthia, our Charge Nurse."
    problem: "The Problem"
    problem-content: "Mobile Heartbeat is a clinical communication tool in 92 hospitals and with over 100,000 active users. Although this product has a deep userbase, the company had not focused on experience design in it's past, and end-users complained that the product had grown dated, unintuitive, and frustrating. Physicians were rejecting the application because it didn't support their specific workflow, and urgent communications were a burden. I was brought on to establish a UX culture within the company, and lead the redesign of their iOS, Android, and web applications to help solve these problems."
    solutions: "Solutions"
    solutions-content: "When we felt we had solid concepts, we conducted extensive end-user testing to validate (or revise) our solutions before implementation. This included in-person user testing via InVision prototypes. We conducted these tests in hospitals throughout the country, and evolved our designs based on the feedback. As a result, we were able to begin development with confidence in our approach."
    solution-1-alt: "My status screen displaying presence, unit, roles, and schedule."
    solution-1-footnote: "Previously, all functionality in the app was funnelled through a single &rsquo;home&rdquo; screen. By reorganizing our features into a bottom tab bar, we could move all core functionality to single press away, and with clear visual signifiers."
    team: "Team & Role"
    team-content: "I led the design of the project with the help of the two designers on my team. This included the coordination of all facets of the design including information architecture, visual design, interaction design, prototyping, and usability testing. This was a highly collaborative effort that included many resources from Product & Engineering."
    users: "Our Users"
    users-content: "The product is deeply rooted in many facilities, and is used by both clinical and non-clinical users throughout the hospital. This includes nurses, physicians, unit secretaries, and housekeeping. Our users have a broad range of goals, technical proficiency, native languages, and accessibility needs. This was a primary challenge for us as we tried to balance providing both a simple and intuitive experience for all while enabling our power users equally."
    wireframe-alt: "Medium fidelity wireframes of Mobile Heartbeat."
    wireframe-footnote: "By starting with wireframes we were able to ideate rapidly with minimal commitment. We met with stakeholders, SMEs, and users early and often, and proggressively added detail to our concepts as we received buy in. Once we felt we were in a strong direction with our information architecture and interaction design, we focused on refining our visual design."

    background-content-1: "At HMH Labs, our focus as a tech incubator was to experiment with technology to transform the learning experience for students, teachers, and parents. One project we worked on was the HMH Marketplace, an online marketplace for educators. The following case study outlines the 5-day Design Sprint that we conducted to test & validate this concept."
    background-content-2: "The Sprint Team consisted of three developers, two product managers, a Decider, a Facilitator, and a designer (That's me). We worked in close collaboration with Thoughtbot throughout the Design Sprint and creation of our prototype."

    sketch-alt: "Crazy 8 sketching exercise."
    sketch-content: "Tuesday was all about rapid ideation and collaboration. After conducting some industry research as a group, we created a diverse set of solutions through rapid sketching exercises. This was a refreshing experience, as many members of the sprint team were not experienced product designers, and enjoyed the unique opportunity to grab a pen and participate in the process."
    sketch-footnote: "The morning was spent conducting various &rsquo;Crazy 8.&rdquo; sketching exercises to rapidly ideate on rough concepts. After each round, the team members presented their ideas and we voted on the viable solutions. Once we had a collection of realistic options, we each focused on a solution to flesh out. We gave ourselves more time to think through the details and provide a presentable option to be considered for the prototype."

    understand-content: "We began by defining our challenge, which was to create an online marketplace for educators and developers to buy and sell digital resources. We created an affinity map to catalog and organize our ideas, defined our personas, and created a basic journey map to visualize the customer experience. At the end of the day, we determined our success metrics by following the Google HEART Framework."
    understand-alt-1: "Completed Lean UX Canvas with heatmap voting."
    understand-alt-2: "Buyer user journey map."
    understand-footnote-1: "We used the &rsquo;How Might We.&rdquo; method to catalog our ideas and assumptions in the morning. Once we had a large sample set of ideas on the board, we organized them into an affinity map to identify themes and categories. We then voted as a group on the ideas that we wanted to be mindful of moving forward."
    understand-footnote-2: "Additionally, we created a rough journey map to determine how our customer would experience the product. This helped us established a user-centric mindset from the beginning and remain empathetic to their goals throughout the week."

    design-process-alt: "Sketch of Mobile Heartbeat information architecture."
    design-process-content: "The culture Iâ€™ve worked to establish is that of highly rapid, transparent, and collaborative design and prototyping. We began with brainstorming workshops, low-fidelity sketches, wireframes, and then increased in detail as our vision became more defined. Additionally, we maintained a regular feedback loop with our users throughout the design process."
    design-process-footnote: "Based on our user feedback, it was clear that the navigation of Mobile Heartbeat needed to improve. Through card sorting studies, we were able to simplify the navigation and organize related functionality into intuitive groupings on the bottom tab bar."
    design-process-heading: "Design Process"
    discovery-alt: "Discovery process using UX Lean Canvas"
    discovery-content: "Our users have highly specific and complex workflows, and we needed to make sure to thoroughly research and understand them. Our research included shadowing, interviewing, focus groups & surveys. This ranged from observing a chaotic night shift in a Manhattan ER, to scrubbing into the OR to see how surgical teams communicate. As a result, we built a stronger understanding of the goals & frustrations of our customers."
    discovery-footnote: "We chose to follow the Lean UX Canvas for initial problem definition to help us maintain focus and establish measurable outcomes. Through our process, we formulated three hypotheses to measure against. In addition to a complete UI redesign of the application, we focused on solving the core problems around our information architecture, physician workflow, and speed of urgent communications."
    discovery-heading: "Discovery Phase"
    outcome-content-1: "We are currently in the process of beta testing our MVP and it has been well received by users. We will be of implementing NPS surveys to compare against our original findings, and implementing Appsee to collect analytics on the increased speed of urgent communications. Additionally, we've been accepted into an Apple partnership program due to our modern design approach."
    outcome-content-2: "We learned a lot from carrying out a product redesign of this scale. Platform consistency became a pain point during the design, and as a response we created a design system to unify our solutions. Moving forward, we would introduce this earlier in the process. Additionally, for future projects I would include more engineers and stakeholders in the initial discovery research, as their expertise would have been valuable at that initial stage."

    overview-heading: "Enabling clinicians to improve patient care through accelerated communication and collaboration in the hospital."
    persona-alt: "Clinical user persona"
    persona-footnote: "We created personas of our core users and gave them personalities, goals, and priorities. This helped us journey map ideal workflows during the design phase, and maintain a user-centric perspective for the other teams throughout the process. I'd like to introduce you to Cynthia, our Charge Nurse."
    problem-content: "Mobile Heartbeat is a clinical communication tool in 92 hospitals and with over 100,000 active users. Although this product has a deep userbase, the company had not focused on experience design in it's past, and end-users complained that the product had grown dated, unintuitive, and frustrating. Physicians were rejecting the application because it didn't support their specific workflow, and urgent communications were a burden. I was brought on to establish a UX culture within the company, and lead the redesign of their iOS, Android, and web applications to help solve these problems."
    problem-heading: "The Problem"
    solutions-content: "When we felt we had solid concepts, we conducted extensive end-user testing to validate (or revise) our solutions before implementation. This included in-person user testing via InVision prototypes. We conducted these tests in hospitals throughout the country, and evolved our designs based on the feedback. As a result, we were able to begin development with confidence in our approach."
    solutions-heading: "Solutions"
    solution-1-alt: "My status screen displaying presence, unit, roles, and schedule."
    solution-1-footnote: "Previously, all functionality in the app was funnelled through a single &rsquo;home&rdquo; screen. By reorganizing our features into a bottom tab bar, we could move all core functionality to single press away, and with clear visual signifiers."
    solution-2-alt: "Telemetry long look notification."
    solution-2-footnote: "Enabling our power users was a major focus of ours. By introducing 3D Touch and long look notifications in iOS, users could access deep, critical functionality from the root of the application or within the context of an alert."
    solution-3-alt: "Select units screen."
    solution-3-footnote: "To support the physician workflow better, we designed a way for clinicians to select and convey their presence in multiple units and facilities, as providers are often highly mobile and transient throughout the hospital."
    solution-4-alt: "Mobile Heartbeat favorites screen."
    solution-4-footnote: "Additionally, we expanded on the dynamic role feature, a critical part of the physician workflow that allowed them to assign themselves unique roles in the hospitals. Now users would be able to search/browse, favorite, text, and assign patients to dynamic roles."
    solution-5-alt: "Contact screen with urgent message banner."
    solution-5-footnote: "Because clinical users receive lots of communications throughout the day, we needed to ensure urgent notifications were never lost. To solve this, we created the &rsquo;urgent banner.&rdquo; This element populates every screen when triggered and can be directly actioned on so the user can respond immediately. Once the notification is marked as read, the banner is removed."
    solution-6-alt: "Urgent texting interface."
    solution-6-footnote: "To increase the speed of critical communications, we redesigned the texting module. During emergencies, the user is often extremely stressed with a dramatically increased cognitive load. By having a clear visual indicator near the input, the clinician will intuitively be able to identify and send critical texts to notify the care team."
    team-content: "I led the design of the project with the help of the two designers on my team. This included the coordination of all facets of the design including information architecture, visual design, interaction design, prototyping, and usability testing. This was a highly collaborative effort that included many resources from Product & Engineering."
    team-heading: "Team & Role"
    users-content: "The product is deeply rooted in many facilities, and is used by both clinical and non-clinical users throughout the hospital. This includes nurses, physicians, unit secretaries, and housekeeping. Our users have a broad range of goals, technical proficiency, native languages, and accessibility needs. This was a primary challenge for us as we tried to balance providing both a simple and intuitive experience for all while enabling our power users equally."
    users-heading: "Our Users"
    wireframe-alt: "Medium fidelity wireframes of Mobile Heartbeat."
    wireframe-footnote: "By starting with wireframes we were able to ideate rapidly with minimal commitment. We met with stakeholders, SMEs, and users early and often, and proggressively added detail to our concepts as we received buy in. Once we felt we were in a strong direction with our information architecture and interaction design, we focused on refining our visual design."
